Style guide
===========

Name assigning
--------------
*	A name assigned to a variable, class or function may contain more than one word. In this case any new word after the first word will begin with a capital letter. 
*	Single letter variables should be avoided, except in for- or while loops.

Comments
--------
*	Comments begin with “/**” and end with “*/”. All lines in between will start with a “*”. Inline comments will be denoted by beginning with “//”.

Dots
----
*	Dots are used to access variables or functions within an object.

Spacing
-------
*	Tabs are similar to 4 spaces.
*	if, for or while will always have a space between them and the logical expression. They will always open on the same line but close on a new line.

Curly braces
------------
*	Curly braces will never be skipped, also when this does not cause problems to the program.
 
Ternary operator
----------------
*	The Ternary operator, ?, should not be used.
